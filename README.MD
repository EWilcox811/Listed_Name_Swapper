This project was something that I created for my wife who is teaching from home.
She didn't like that the attendance sheet didn't show the students names the same as
they showed up on there zoom classroom.  This simply takes the list of students as a string
separates them and swaps the order of the first and last name.
So if you have a list of names that is as follows:
Last Name, First Name Middle Initial
Last Name, First Name Middle Initial
Last Name, First Name Middle Initial
This simple python script will use two functions that read the list from a .txt file
then swap the first and last names and remove the comma and you will be left with a list
like this:
First Name Middle Initial Last Name
First Name Middle Initial Last Name
First Name Middle Initial Last Name
The middle initial is optional as it is for most things.  For privacy purposes I have excluded the
lists that I used from the repository so you will have to change the file names and such to wherever
your file resides.
